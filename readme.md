In February 2022, I started to do programming on a regular basis. I have some dev background so i start remember and refresh the skills obtained during university and to develop in new topical directions. In the summer of the same year, I got acquainted with web3 and immersed myself in it. I became a nodrunner, began to study blockchains and the possibility of developing my own application on the blockchain. I spend all my free time studying and exploring new horizons in web3. I see the goal and know where I'm going - that's great. Also I'm a member of Nodera community the motto of which is "In Web3 we trust" - what I absolutely agree with.

My Discord nickname is und3rgr0und#8113.
Nodera community server - https://discord.gg/trafB7Pb75

I see the goal - I see no obstacles ! Let's go for it !
